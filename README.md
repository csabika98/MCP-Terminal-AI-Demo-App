# MCP-Terminal-App

A terminal-based AI assistant powered by a Master Control Program (MCP) interface and a local LLM. Run natural language commands like execute, create, list, and more—directly on your machine.

Works with any local LLM (e.g., via Ollama)

Interprets and runs shell-level commands through natural language like 

execute – run terminal commands

list – view directories, processes, etc.

remove – delete files or folders

write / create – generate files or scripts


Can be run locally with no external API calls (privacy-focused) or via API
