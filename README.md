# MCP-Terminal-App

A terminal-based AI assistant powered by a Master Control Program (MCP) interface and a local LLM. Run natural language commands like `execute`, `create`, `list`, and more—directly on your machine.

## Under-development, it will be public later.

## Features

- Works with any local LLM (e.g., via Ollama)
- Interprets and runs shell-level commands through natural language
- FOR EXAMPLE:
  - `execute` – run terminal commands
  - `list` – view directories, processes, etc.
  - `remove` – delete files or folders
  - `write` / `create` – generate files or scripts
- Runs locally with no external API calls (privacy-focused) or via API calls
